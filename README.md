# FreshMart
I designed and developed a feature-rich E-commerce grocery website with an engaging user interface that incorporates smooth animations for a polished appearance. This project was implemented using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS for client-side styling.

Key Features:

Wishlist and Add to Cart: Implemented essential features like "Wishlist" and "Add to Cart" to enhance the user shopping experience.

Intuitive Navigation: Simplified product navigation with functionalities like "Shop by Category" and "Shop by Item," making it easy for users to browse and find products.

Blog Integration: Improved website engagement by seamlessly integrating an admin-managed blog. This blog allows for sharing recipes and community updates, fostering a sense of community and interaction among users.
